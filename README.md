Project Documentation: Banquet Hall Booking Websiteüëç

Introduction:

The Event Hall Booking System based on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is a web application that allows users to search for and book event halls or banquet venues. It utilizes MongoDB as the database to store and manage data, Express.js for server-side handling of requests, React for building a dynamic user interface, and Node.js as the runtime environment.
