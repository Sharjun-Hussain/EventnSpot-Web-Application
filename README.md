# Project Documentation: Banquet Hall Booking Website👍

## Introduction:

>The Event Hall Booking System based on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is a web application that allows users to search for and book event halls or banquet venues. It utilizes MongoDB as the database to store and manage data, Express.js for server-side handling of requests, React for building a dynamic user interface, and Node.js as the runtime environment. The system provides functionalities such as venue search, real-time availability checking, user authentication and authorization, booking management, and communication through email notifications. It offers a seamless and efficient experience for users to find and book event halls for their desired dates and requirements.
